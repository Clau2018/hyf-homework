How To Make the Best Homemade Chocolate Ice Cream

Good chocolate ice cream has contrasting allure. It’s rich, cool, and creamy with dark roasted flavors only cocoa can impart. This chocolate ice cream is for the real die-hard chocolate-lovers in the group. It’s sweet and malty, with the tiniest bitter tones to balance that sweetness. Almost right in the middle between dark chocolate and milk, it’s the kind of chocolate ice cream that doesn’t leave you wishing there was more chocolate in the mix or less.

After tasting and testing several chocolate ice cream recipes, I can firmly say this is the best one I’ve tried yet. For starters, this ice cream’s base doesn’t require tempering eggs with hot cream, so it’s easier to make. It has not one but three types of chocolate, and it doesn’t freeze up impossibly hard to scoop, thanks to a secret ingredient.
What Is a Philly-Style Ice Cream?
Philly- or, more aptly, Philadelphia-style ice cream is made from cream, sugar, and flavoring.

It lets the chocolate flavor come through without any eggy undertones. You get pure, dense chocolatey flavor through and through.
